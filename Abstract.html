  <h3>A Blockchain and Machine Learning Solution for building Trust in Textiles</h3>
  <p>
    Every fabric holds a secret—woven in its threads, revealed in its touch, and defined by its purity. The textile industry prioritizes transparency, sustainability, and authenticity, but traditional supply chains lack clarity and genuineness. This leaves weavers underpaid and unrecognized, while counterfeit products continue to grow in the market. The proposed system ‘Blockchain and Machine Learning Solution for building Trust in Textiles’ integrates blockchain for secure traceability and machine learning for fabric purity analysis. The application securely documents the entire production process on an immutable blockchain, from raw material procurement to pre-weaving, pattern designing, yarn dyeing, fabric weaving, and post-weaving stages. The application uses machine learning to analyze fabric data, enabling secure and transparent tracking while detecting fabric authenticity, blends, and adulteration. . Customers can scan a fabric identifier on clothing to access textile details, including yarn material, ply type, twist, fiber length, and yarn quality. By combining blockchain and machine learning, this solution builds trust between brands and consumers, supports ethical practices, and helps people make better purchasing decisions.
