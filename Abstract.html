  <h3>A Blockchain and Machine Learning Solution for building Trust in Textiles</h3>
  <p>
    As time goes on, there is a growing need to use new technologies in the textile industry to attain transparency and sustainability and to identify pure fabrics from low-cost imitations. The textile supply chain ensures secure, transparent tracking and analyzes fabric purity to identify blends, fakes, or synthetics using machine learning techniques. Customers canscan a fabric identifier on clothing to access comprehensive details, including yarn material, ply type, twist, fiber length, and yarn quality. The application documents the entire production process, from raw material procurement to pre-weaving, pattern designing, yarn dyeing, fabric weaving, and post-weaving stages, storing all data securely on an immutable blockchain. Enhancing user experience, the application integrates machine learning to analyze fabric data, enabling it to checks the purity of the fabric and identifies whether it is blended, adulterated, or synthetic. By combining blockchain and machine learning, this solution builds trust between brands and consumers, supports ethical practices, and helps people make better purchasing decisions.
